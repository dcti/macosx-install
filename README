Built with PackageMaker included with XCode

Requires 10.4+ ppc/intel

Uninstall is provided by manual script (uninstall.sh)

Installs to /Applications/distributed.net/

Defaults to installing for startup (dnetc -install) and asking for
configuration (dnetc -config) at install time. These are user
selectable options.

To build packages, the latest client should be in ../distributed.net
and the resulting package should be named according the client used.
Ideally a universal (ppc/x86/amd64) client would be chosen.

Scripts for client install/uninstall/config are left in the installed
directory, along with a package uninstaller which reverses everything
done by the installing and removes the files. These can be run
manually from the command line.
